# Cybersecurity-Suspicious-Web-Threat-Interaction
This project analyzes web traffic logs to detect suspicious or potentially harmful activities using Machine Learning. It follows a step-by-step data analysis and anomaly detection workflow based on AWS CloudWatch web traffic data.
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Domain: Data Analysis / Cybersecurity

Goal: Detect anomalies in web interactions and identify suspicious activities

Dataset: AWS CloudWatch suspicious traffic logs

Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

Each record contains:

bytes_in â€“ Bytes received by the server

bytes_out â€“ Bytes sent from the server

creation_time & end_time â€“ Session timestamps

src_ip & src_ip_country_code â€“ Source IP details

protocol â€“ Connection protocol used

dst_port â€“ Destination server port

detection_types â€“ Type of detection applied

ðŸ“Š Steps Performed

Data Import & Basic Overview â€“ Loaded dataset and explored structure

Data Preprocessing â€“ Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized traffic patterns, protocol usage, and suspicious ports

Feature Engineering â€“ Created session_duration and avg_packet_size

Visualization â€“ Country-based analysis, suspicious port activities, traffic trends

Anomaly Detection â€“ Used Isolation Forest to detect suspicious sessions

Anomaly Visualization â€“ Scatter plot showing normal vs suspicious traffic

Report Findings â€“ Key insights and cybersecurity implications
